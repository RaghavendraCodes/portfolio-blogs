# THE CASIO FX-100MS

First year of engineering. Like every overenthusiastic fresher, I got myself a brand-new calculator, thinking it would be my right-hand man for four years.  
**Big mistake.**

Lost it in the very first year.  
Maybe in class.  
Maybe in the library.  
Maybe it just ran away.  

And anyways—no new gadget has ever stayed with me for a long time. I have always lost it.

And then, I found him covered with dust in a drawer.  
**The legend. The myth. The one who ruled over numbers like an old king—**  
**CASIO FX-100MS.**

Unshaken. Absolute.  
It never flinched, never failed.  
My dad, a civil engineer, placed his trust in it, and it delivered to perfection.  
No complaints. No breakdowns. Just cold with those calculations.  

I picked it up, pressed `ON`, and just like that—its reign continued.

---

Years have passed, and it still stands strong.  
I have no idea when my dad got it—maybe before I was born.

And then I heard about my friend’s Casio.  
The brother—**FX-991MS**.  
Same unshakable will. Only his calculator had served not one, not two, but three generations.  

And just recently, after decades of loyal service, it finally took its last breath.

Which makes me wonder...  
Mine still has at least one more generation to go.

Considering its legacy,  
I might just pass it down to my grandkids.

And honestly?  
**It might just outlive us all.**
