I am one of those who admires data structures a lot.  
So, I let my imagination take over… and this is what I saw.

Array was structured, predictable, always in order.  
Every step he took was measured, every move precise.  
He liked things to be just as they were —  
where finding something was as easy as knowing its position.  
Life was sorted, simple, steady.

Until he met her.  
**LinkedList.**

![LinkedList vibes](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5hBg8FnA--/c_limit,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jqk5f7y2zphf7a6muwoe.png)

She was different.  
She never stayed in one place,  
always pointing somewhere else, always moving forward.  
She flowed effortlessly, linking one memory to another.  
While he believed in fixed positions,  
she believed in **connections**.

Array was mesmerized.

She could grow without limits, expand without shifting.  
She was everything he wasn’t.  
He admired how she could insert new moments anywhere,  
while he had to push and adjust everything just to make space.

She, in turn, envied how he could find things instantly,  
while she had to search, step by step, one link at a time.

Somewhere, between structure and freedom,  
between order and flow, they found moments where they worked together.  
In some algorithms, they were perfect.  
But deep down, they knew —  
they were built differently.

And one day,  
she moved ahead.  
That’s the thing about her — she doesn’t stay.  
She grows, expands, finds new paths.

And Array?

He stayed where he was,  
holding on to old memories.  
But when new ones came,  
he had to erase the past.  
There was never enough space for both.

Whose mistake was it?  
Was it LinkedList, because she moved on with her connections?  
Or was it Array’s, because he was bound by his limits?

The truth is — neither was wrong.

Because in life, sometimes we have to be like **LinkedList** —  
move on, grow, embrace the unknown.

And sometimes, we have to be like **Array** —  
let go of old memories to make space for new ones.

Maybe, after all,  
**life isn’t so different from data structures.**

Others are like LinkedLists — flexible, slow, but deeply connected.”_
