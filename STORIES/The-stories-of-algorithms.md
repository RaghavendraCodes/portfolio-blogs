# THE STORY OF ALGORITHMS

Ever lost yourself in a story?  
The kind where each moment pulls you forward and you turn pages just to see how it unfolds.  
A good algorithm is no different. It isn't just some lines written.  
I mean, a story isn't just words, the same way algorithms aren't just code.

It’s a map—loops, branches, paths to be taken.  
It's a journey where variables set out to find others on the way,  
and some are bound inside loops,  
have to leave them in between,  
to continue the voyage till the end.

Most people think it’s about understanding—the syntax, the structure, the rules.  
But that’s like memorizing a plot without ever feeling the story.

**It’s not about _can you solve it?_**  
**It’s about _can you see it?_**

- Can you sense recursion, like reliving a memory, each pass revealing more?  
- Can you feel the if-else, like a split-second decision you took?  
- Can you trace loops, like routines we repeat, hoping for a break?  
- Greedy choices feel right in the moment—until you see the bigger picture.  
- DP remembers what we forget, weaving past decisions into the future.  
- Sorting brings order to chaos, while searching finds anything even within that chaos.

And only when you step in, you see it—  
Not just logic, but a **narrative unfolding**.  
Not just a sequence, but a **purpose**.

Because once you do…  
you stop just writing algorithms.  
You start **seeing** them.  
You start **hearing** them.

And at that moment, they’re no longer just code.  
They become **stories waiting to unfold**.
