# From Clueless to Confident — Our IoT RC Car Journey

Road accidents are a serious concern, and while high-end vehicles are equipped with cutting-edge safety features, affordable and heavy vehicles like buses and trucks often miss out. That’s what sparked the idea for our project — to build a smart RC car prototype that could detect obstacles, monitor blind spots, and react automatically to avoid collisions. But this story isn’t just about a car — it’s about how four of us, who knew nothing about IoT, came together, struggled, and pulled off something we’re incredibly proud of.

We started with absolutely zero knowledge of IoT. None of us had worked with an ESP32 before or connected a sensor to a microcontroller. When our project mentor suggested we try something in IoT, we were blank. Clueless. But curious. That curiosity led us to join a workshop on IoT, where we learned the basics — what an ESP32 is, how ultrasonic and IR sensors work, and how to flash code into a board. We got a rough idea of what we were getting into, but building a real, working system was still a distant dream.

Eventually, we needed help. Rahul reached out to his friends from ECE, and Gajanana brought in his IoT contacts. They helped us with the wiring, connections, and basic sensor logic. It started making sense, piece by piece. But even then, challenges didn’t wait.

Our first major issue was the LCD display — it just wouldn’t show anything. No backlight, no text, nothing. We tried different codes, rewired it multiple times, and even doubted if the display itself was damaged. Thankfully, one of our teammates' friends helped us out, and we finally saw characters blinking on the screen. That small win meant a lot.

The next big challenge was building the RC car. We hadn’t realized that the motors required a high-powered battery and a proper charger. So off we went to SP Road, again and again, buying parts and tools. That battery? Let’s just say — all of us got shocked at some point while handling it. And not once — *multiple times*. Getting shocked became a running joke within the team.

As the review deadline got closer, we knew we needed an overnight push. We decided to stay at our friend Gandhi’s rented house for a night, where we set up our workspace in one of the rooms. It was filled with wires, chargers, snacks, and tired faces. And then, sometime around 2 AM — the car moved. The wheels rotated. The logic worked. That one moment felt like everything we’d been working for had come alive. This was just two or three days before our final review.

But, as expected, the next day it stopped working again. We were drained and out of ideas. One of our friends even suggested scrapping the ESP32 and building everything from scratch using Raspberry Pi. That suggestion hit hard. We seriously considered it — should we start over? Should we give up on the ESP32?

In the end, we trusted our gut. We decided to continue with the ESP32, believing deep down that we could make it work. The day before the final review, we started working at 12 PM and kept going until 8 PM. By evening, the entire system was working — obstacle detection, speed control, blindspot alerts — all of it. That night, Gajanana and Revanth stayed back, fixed all remaining issues, and set everything in place.

The day of the final review arrived. We walked in expecting to be scolded or told we didn’t do enough. But to our surprise, our teacher was extremely happy with our project. She appreciated the effort, the clarity, the working model, and the presentation. And then she gave us a full 50 out of 50. We were speechless.

From not knowing how to connect a single wire to debugging every component ourselves — we had come a long way. Revanth was the debug master. Gajanana made sure we stayed united and focused. Rahul was brilliant with his technical knowledge. Each of us gave our best, and it all came together like magic.

This project was not just about IoT or RC cars. It was about learning, failing, retrying, staying up late, asking for help, and not giving up. It was a rollercoaster ride — full of moments that tested us and taught us.

In the end, we proved something very real: **Efforts never go waste. I repeat, they never.**

We started the journey by cursing ourselves for taking up an IoT project.  
We ended it by proudly telling ourselves: *"We did it."*
